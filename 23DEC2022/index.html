    <strong>Deep Copy:</strong> While making a copy, the values from the
    original variable is copied to the new variable but there is no relation
    between the original and new (copied) variable. Also, If we change the value
    of the original variable that will not have any effect on the value of the
    copied variable. <br />
    <h4>
      The various primitive data types are: Number, String and Boolean When you
      copy a variable that consists of these data types, you will get a real
      copy (deep copy).
    </h4>

    <strong>Shallow Copy:</strong> When you copy a variable, the values from the
    original variable are copied to the new one, but certain values remain
    linked to the original variable. <br />
    <h4>
      The various composite data types in Js are objects and arrays. In js array
      is also an object. When these types of data are used, the values are only
      stored once upon the creation of an object. When you try to make a copy of
      these variables, it just creates a pointer( reference ) to the original
      object. This is called Shallow Copy.
